Approach:

We made use of Python scripts to automate certain processes. The given data sets were extracted and segregated into two folders, one containing benign applications and the other containing malicious applications. We use a static analysis approach to extract the features. All the important and relevant information is stored in the application manifest file. We ran a python script, that collects only the manifest files from each corresponding application folder
and stores all manifest files of benign apps in a folder and those of malicious applications in another folder.

We use a machine learning approach to improve the efficiency with which the system classifies the applications as benign or malicious. Since we already had a labelled dataset we used a supervised machine-learning approach. The training dataset is evaluated using features and a class label.

Since we use a static analysis approach the feature extraction is performed by extracting valuable information from the AndroidManifest.xml file. We use features such as the uses- permission, uses-feature and intent actions from the AndroidManifest file. We found that when the machine learning model is trained using more features, the overall accuracy of the model increases.

The dataset to train and test the model is obtained by extracting the various features from the AndroidManifest.xml file and storing the same in a .csv file. All the extracted features were labelled ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’. A binary representation was used where ‘1’ denoted that the extracted feature is being used or requested by the application and ‘0’ denoted that the extracted feature is not requested.

Once the dataset was ready, we had to train and test the models. We used a 5-fold cross-validation where 80% of the dataset was used for training and the remaining 20% was used for testing.

We have computed the result using Support Vector Machine (SVM), kNeighbour, Adaboost, RanfomForest, ExtraTrees, Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) classifier.

Datasets Used:

The experiment was performed using the dataset distributed in class and also on an additional dataset containing 11,000 apps with approximately 8000 benign apps and the rest malicious.
